      "Sunday is the real sheet. The ladder starts with Jacksonville, Detroit, and the Chargers — three mismatches, true-odds moneylines, not a 6-to-1 lounge card. Add Philadelphia, then Cincinnati, then Chicago if you want the extra rungs. Leave Buffalo/Houston, Green Bay/Minnesota, the Jets, and Monday night off the parlay.",
